# Pipeline-For-NLP-With-Blooms-Taxonomy-Improved-Question-Classification-And-Question-Generation
This repository contains all the source code that is needed for the Project : An Efficient Pipeline For Bloom’s Taxonomy Using Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning.

## Outline : 
An examination assessment undertaken by educational institutions is an essential process, since it is one of the fundamental steps to determine a student’s progress and achievements for a distinct subject or course. To meet learning objectives, the questions must be presented by the topics, that are mastered by the students. Generation of examination questions from an extensive amount of available text material presents some complications. The current availability of huge lengths of textbooks makes it a slow and time-consuming task for a faculty when it comes to manually annotate good quality of questions keeping in mind, they are well balanced as well. As a result, faculties rely on Bloom’s taxonomy's cognitive domain, which is a popular framework, for assessing students’ intellectual abilities. 
Therefore, the primary goal of this research paper is to demonstrate an effective pipeline for the generation of questions using deep learning from a given text corpus. We also employ various neural network architectures to classify questions into the cognitive domain of different levels of Bloom’s taxonomy using deep learning, to derive questions and judge the complexity and specificity of those questions. 
The findings from this study showed that the proposed pipeline is significant in generating the questions, which were equally similar concerning manually annotated questions and classifying questions from multiple domains based on Bloom’s taxonomy.


## Question Classification Module : 
Deep learning-based model for multi class classification which takes in a text as input and tries to classify a certain category out of multiple categories
